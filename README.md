ReMind UI frontend
==================

ReMind is a minimalistic partial Getting Things Done (GTD) system
that focuses on the Collect and Process part of GTD.

It provides two use cases:

	1. Collecting a thought via mobile phone browser.
	2. Processing previous thoughts on a desktop browser.

That's it!

The web service repo is [remind-backend](https://github.com/objarni/remind-backend).

Tech
----

ReMind UI uses HTML and JavaScript with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) to implement web service
and data updates.

The response CSS design is based on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).
